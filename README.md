## Current state of our website

> Right now you can register as a user, sign in, and submit entries of either an Online Assesment, Interview, or Job Application. These entries will be displayed in a table on the dashboard and will persist for each user under their account.

## What does your application do?

### Gives a platform for speciically developers to keep track of jobs they've applied to, have OA's for, and display it using a calendar

## What makes it different than a CRUD app? I.e., what functionality does it provide that is not just a user interface layer on top of a database of user information,and the ability to view / add to / change that information?

### There will be a feature to suggest jobs similar to jobs you've applied to by using a job api

## What security and privacy concerns do you expect you (as developers) or your users to have with this application?

### We need to keep user's passwords safe by encrpyting them before they are stored in the database, also authenticate users when navigating around the website
