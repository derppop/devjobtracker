## What does your application do?

## Gives a platform for speciically developers to keep track of jobs they've applied to, have OA's for, and display it using a calendar

## What makes it different than a CRUD app? I.e., what functionality does it provide that is not just a user interface layer on top of a database of user information,and the ability to view / add to / change that information?

## There will be a feature to suggest jobs similar to jobs you've applied to by using a job api

## What security and privacy concerns do you expect you (as developers) or your users to have with this application?

## We need to keep user's passwords safe by encrpyting them before they are stored in the database, also authenticate users when navigating around the website

### This repository

This repository has a package.json that functions as a blank shell that gets full credit if you turn it in to the gradescope autograder. We will not be using the autograder in any way to actually evaluate your project, it is just there to keep track of your initial submission.

We recommend that you use this repository for your final project code. This will allow you to ask questions on Piazza and get help from the TAs and instructors. Adding a real linter, type checker, etc, based on our other examples would be a good idea.
